- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pedr0Leite, I'm a ServiceNow Lead Application Developer with a true passion for coding.

- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript, NodeJS, React, ServiceNow, Ethical Hacking and Coding in general!
I also love spending time doing some coding challenges in many platforms such as:
  - HackerRank
  - LeetCode
  - Codewars 
 
![codewars level](https://www.codewars.com/users/Pedr0Leite/badges/small)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and improving my ServiceNow knowledge (cuz it's kind of my job!)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any OpenSource project that I can help with, I love to help and contribute!
